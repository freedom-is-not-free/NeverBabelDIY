Windows 10: preface
========

as have been mentioned, although Windows is NOT a FOSS(Free and Open-Source Software) OS, it's good to begin from it. and some beginners might even later get used to a FOSS OS(like GNU/Linux).

as of 2022, a new Laptop is probably pre-Installed with Windows 10. some manufacturers even provide a quick way to reset the OS(here it's Windows 10) of your Laptop(WARNING: ALL USER DATA WILL BE GONE BY DOING SO; SAVE THEM BEFORE THE RESET), and of coz. you can contact the custome service of your manufacturer to get guide if you need/want to.

however, it's possible that your Laptop manufacturer have added something other than the pure OS(here it's Windows 10). although many of them are harmless(yet perhaps slow down your PC), some are NOT friendly or even harmful and is hence called Malware. e.g you can Search Online "malware laptop build-in", and if you can see NO related result pages at all, change a Search Engine because it's likely that that Search Engine is compromised, at least at this moment on this issue.

so I personally recommend Installing Windows 10 yourself.

Windows 10: Chapter 0: prerequisite
--------

1. you have a PC
2. you have a network connection
3. you have a Disk(better to be an SSD as of 2022) of at least about 128GB
4. you have no Data to save on this Disk
5. you have a Flash Drive of at least 8GB
6. you have no Data to save on this Flash Drive
7. you have a PC Running Windows(it can be the PC mentioned in prerequisite 1), so that it can be used to Download, Verify & Burn the Installer of our OS (Windows 10)1

Windows 10: Chapter 1: Download the Installer 
--------

this is the official link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

or you can simply contact Microsoft to retrieve a copy of Windows 10. 

either way, you need to BUY an Activation Code from Microsoft. but in the case you already have bought a Laptop with Windows 10 pre-Installed(which was actually paid by you the consumer) but you want to Install Windows 10 yourself, can you get the Activation Code - whether from Microsoft or your Laptop manufacturer - for free?
